# News-Driven Trading System - Claude Context

A trustworthy, low-latency trading backend that reacts to credible market-moving information with explainable decisions and robust safety guardrails.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed (Sessions 1-17)
- **Decision Engine**: Core gates (global_pause, halt, session, liquidity, corroboration, earnings_embargo, frozen) and threshold mapping
- **Structured Logging**: JSON decision reasons with fused scores and gate details
- **Testing Framework**: End-to-end integration tests with 10 comprehensive scenarios covering all gate logic, wire ingestion, Slack integration, and risk controls
- **Observability**: Metrics collection and HTTP endpoint with gate-specific counters, decision latency tracking, and Slack metrics
- **Safety Rails**: Paper mode with global pause protection, environment variable overrides, and test isolation
- **PR Corroboration**: Soft gate requiring editorial confirmation within 15-minute window for PR-driven decisions
- **Earnings Embargo**: Soft gate converting BUYâ†’HOLD during earnings windows with configurable buffers
- **Paper Trading Outbox**: Transactional order persistence with mock fills, idempotency, and JSONL audit trail
- **Wire Protocol Ingestion**: HTTP polling client with cursor-based streaming, exponential backoff, and bounded execution
- **Slack Alerts & Controls**: Real-time decision alerts with rate limiting, slash commands for operational control (/pause, /resume, /freeze), and runtime configuration overrides
- **Advanced Risk Controls**: Stop-loss with 24h cooldown, sector exposure limits (40% max), drawdown monitoring (2%/3% daily thresholds), and Slack dashboard for real-time portfolio monitoring
- **SSE Streaming Transport**: Real-time Server-Sent Events transport with reconnection logic, gap detection, backpressure handling, and 700% performance improvement over HTTP polling
- **Live Quote Feeds (Session 17)**: Alpha Vantage shadow mode with canary rollout, budget-aware sampling, hotpath protection, health monitoring with hysteresis, promotion gates automation, and comprehensive production readiness validation

## Development Workflow

### Session-Based Development
Each development session follows the "Vibe Coding" protocol (see `docs/VIBE-CODING-GUIDE.md`):

**Session Structure (60-90 min max)**:
1. **Pre-Session** (5 min): Check TODO, run health checks, create session card
2. **Planning** (10-15 min): Define acceptance criteria, identify contracts/fixtures
3. **Implementation** (30-50 min): Red-Green-Refactor with evidence collection
4. **Validation** (10-15 min): End-to-end testing and edge cases
5. **Post-Session** (5-10 min): Document evidence, update TODO.md, git commit/push, update next session plan

**Key Principles**:
- One vertical slice per session
- Evidence-driven development (logs + metrics)
- Safety rails always on (paper mode, global pause)
- Time-boxed with clear acceptance criteria

### Safety-First Approach
- **Always**: `trading_mode: paper` and `global_pause: true`
- **Test First**: Fixtures before real data feeds
- **One Adapter**: Swap providers incrementally  
- **Evidence Required**: All changes must show decision logs + metrics

### Testing Strategy
```bash
make test         # End-to-end integration tests (8 scenarios including Slack integration)
go test ./...     # Unit tests for decision engine and outbox
make doctor       # Tool/dependency check
```

## Troubleshooting & Operations

### Common Issues (Recently Fixed)
- **Tests timeout**: Fixed duplicate metrics server startup in oneshot mode
- **Environment variable conflicts**: Fixed test script to clear GLOBAL_PAUSE/TRADING_MODE for config file control  
- **Timing-dependent test failures**: Updated fixture timestamps to maintain corroboration windows
- **No decisions**: Ensure global_pause=false via config or environment override

## Recent Improvements (Session 5+)

### ðŸ”§ Major Fixes Applied
- **Fixed duplicate metrics server bug**: Removed hardcoded server startup that ignored oneshot flag
- **Added environment variable overrides**: `GLOBAL_PAUSE` and `TRADING_MODE` now properly override config.yaml
