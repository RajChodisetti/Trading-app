curl http://127.0.0.1:8090/healthz/session18 | jq .

# Expected response shows:
# - All 6 core components implemented
# - Production readiness capabilities
# - Next steps for Session 19 integration
```

### Multi-Provider Configuration
```yaml
# config/live_feeds.yaml - Production Ready
feeds:
  quotes:
    live_enabled: false                    # Ready for activation
    shadow_mode: true                      # Comparison capability
    provider_active: "alphavantage"        # Primary provider
    provider_warm: "polygon"               # Warm spare ready
    
    # Gradual expansion ready
