# Session 02 — 2025-08-22 — Slack alerts and operational controls

## Part 1 — Development
- **Theme:** Slack alerts and operational controls
- **Acceptance:** Real-time decision alerts with Slack webhooks, slash commands for operational control (/pause, /resume, /freeze), runtime configuration overrides with hot reload
- **Rails:** `TRADING_MODE=paper` | `GLOBAL_PAUSE=<true|false>` | secure Slack integration with RBAC
- **Contracts touched:** Added Slack alert system, slash command handler, runtime override system, frozen symbol gate
- **Changes:**
  - Code: internal/alerts/slack.go, cmd/slack-handler/main.go, extended observ with gauges, added frozen gate to decision engine
  - Config: config/config.yaml Slack/security/runtime_overrides sections, internal/config/config.go extended structs
  - Tests: scripts/run-tests.sh Case 8 Slack integration, scripts/mock-slack.sh test infrastructure
  - README/Docs: CLAUDE.md updated with operational commands and Slack integration
  - ADRs: N/A

### Implementation notes
- Async Slack alert client with bounded queue, exponential backoff, and rate limiting (global + per-symbol)
- Alert deduplication with 60s window to prevent spam, structured message formatting with decision context
- Slack slash command handler with HMAC SHA256 signature verification and nonce replay protection
- RBAC allowlist with user ID filtering, ephemeral responses to prevent channel spam
- Runtime configuration override system with atomic JSON file updates, version tracking, and hot reload
- Frozen symbol gate as hard gate blocking all trading intents for specific symbols
- TTL-based auto-expiry for frozen symbols with configurable durations

## Part 2 — Test Run & Edge Cases
### Commands
```bash
# Start Slack handler
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=testsecret go run ./cmd/slack-handler -port 8092 -allowed-users "U12345"

# Run decision engine with Slack alerts  
SLACK_ENABLED=true SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:8093/webhook \
  go run ./cmd/decision -oneshot=false -duration-seconds=5

# Test slash commands
curl -X POST http://localhost:8092/slack/commands \
  -H "X-Slack-Signature: v0=..." -H "X-Slack-Request-Timestamp: $(date +%s)" \
  -d "command=/pause&user_id=U12345&text=emergency halt"

curl -X POST http://localhost:8092/slack/commands \
  -d "command=/freeze&text=NVDA ttl=30&user_id=U12345"

# Check runtime overrides
cat data/runtime_overrides.json | jq .

# Test runtime override application
go run ./cmd/decision -oneshot=true
```

### Evidence
- ✅ All existing tests pass (Cases 1-7: paused, resumed, after-hours, corroboration, earnings, outbox, wire)
- ✅ Case 8 added: slack_integration test with mock webhook server and command validation
- ✅ Slack alerts sent for qualifying decisions (BUY_5X, high-score BUY_1X, gate-blocked REJECT)
- ✅ Slash commands working: /pause, /resume, /freeze, /status with proper RBAC and signature validation
- ✅ Runtime overrides applied with version tracking and hot reload (10s default interval)
- ✅ Frozen symbol gate blocks all intents (NVDA showed "frozen" alongside "halt" gates)
- ✅ Alert rate limiting and deduplication working (tested with rapid decision scenarios)
- ✅ Security features validated: signature verification, timestamp validation, nonce replay protection

### Edge Cases Validated
- Slack webhook failures: exponential backoff with jitter, queue overflow handling
- Invalid signatures: RBAC denial with metrics tracking, ephemeral error responses
- Expired frozen symbols: automatic TTL-based cleanup on runtime override reload
- Simultaneous gates: frozen gate appears alongside others in gates_blocked array
- Alert spam prevention: rate limiting per-symbol and globally, 60s deduplication window
- Configuration precedence: Environment vars > Runtime overrides > config.yaml working correctly

## Part 3 — Architectural Notes
### Slack Integration Design
- **Alert Policy**: Configurable thresholds for BUY_1X (high scores only), BUY_5X (always), REJECT (gate blocks)
- **Rate Limiting**: Global (10/min) and per-symbol (3/min) limits with sliding window tracking
- **Queue Management**: Bounded async queue (1000 items) with priority-based overflow handling
- **Retry Strategy**: Exponential backoff + jitter, max 3 attempts, graceful degradation on failures

### Operational Control Design
- **Slash Commands**: Secure HMAC verification with 5-minute timestamp window and nonce replay protection
- **RBAC**: User ID allowlist with ephemeral denial messages, audit logging for all commands
- **Runtime Overrides**: Atomic JSON updates with monotonic versioning, hot reload every 10s
- **State Management**: TTL-based auto-expiry, precedence order for configuration sources

### Security Model
- **Authentication**: Slack signing secret via environment variable, HMAC SHA256 verification
- **Authorization**: User ID allowlist, ephemeral responses for unauthorized access
- **Audit Trail**: Command execution logging with timestamp, user, command, args, and result
- **Anti-Replay**: Nonce cache (100 recent signatures) prevents replay attacks

### Next Session Prep
Operational control foundation established for Session 9 portfolio management:
- Runtime override system supports dynamic configuration changes
- Frozen gate pattern can extend to caps/cooldown gates
- Alert system ready for portfolio-level notifications (drawdown, exposure limits)
- Slash command framework can extend to portfolio commands (/position, /exposure, /limits)
