# Session 16: Live Quote Feeds & System Integration - Stage 1

**Date**: August 25, 2025  
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Focus**: Fix test framework deterministically for reliable integration testing

## Session Overview
This session focused on resolving critical test framework inconsistencies that were blocking reliable integration testing. The primary issue was non-deterministic test behavior causing integration tests to fail unpredictably, particularly around trend-lite signal generation and wire mode processing.

## Achievements ✅

### Stage 1: Test Framework Deterministic Fix (COMPLETED)

#### 1. Fixed after_hours Test Failure
**Problem**: AAPL was getting `BUY_1X` instead of expected `REJECT` due to quote adapter override
**Solution**: Implemented `TEST_MODE=fixtures` environment routing
- Added logic to skip quote adapter when `TEST_MODE=fixtures`
- Ensures pure fixture data usage without mock adapter interference
- AAPL now correctly gets `REJECT` with session+liquidity gates blocked

#### 2. Fixed pr_only Test Failure  
**Problem**: BIOX was getting `REJECT` instead of expected `HOLD` due to mixed data sources
**Solution**: Applied `TEST_MODE=fixtures` consistently across all test cases
- Modified `run_case()` function to use `TEST_MODE=fixtures` for all tests
- BIOX now correctly gets `HOLD` with corroboration gate for PR-only scenarios

#### 3. Fixed wire_mode Critical Bug
**Problem**: Wire mode had zero advice generation due to nested payload parsing failure
**Root Cause**: Wire events contain nested payload structure, but parsing logic expected flat structure
**Solution**: Implemented proper nested payload extraction
- Fixed `processWireEvents()` to extract nested "payload" field from wire event structure  
- Updated newsFile struct to include all fields needed for sentiment analysis
- Added proper JSON unmarshaling for wire event → tick/news data conversion

**Before Fix**:
```
Wire mode tick feature:  last=0.00 vwap=0.00  # All zeros
Advice events: Count: 0                        # No advice generated
AAPL -> HOLD (fused_score: 0)                # No trend-lite signal
```

**After Fix**:
```
Parsed tick AAPL: last=210.02 vwap=209.80     # Correct values
Advice events: Count: 3                        # News + trend-lite generated  
AAPL -> BUY_1X                                # Proper trend-lite signal
```

### Key Technical Changes

#### 1. TEST_MODE Environment Routing
**File**: `cmd/decision/main.go`
```go
// TEST_MODE=fixtures skips quote adapter to use pure fixture data
testMode := os.Getenv("TEST_MODE")
if len(symbols) > 0 && testMode != "fixtures" {
    // Only fetch from quote adapter if not in fixture test mode
    quotes, err := quotesAdapter.GetQuotes(ctx, symbols)
    // ...
}
```

**File**: `scripts/run-tests.sh` 
```bash
# Apply TEST_MODE=fixtures to all test cases for deterministic testing
TEST_MODE=fixtures $BIN -config "$cfgfile" 2>"$TMP_DIR/$name.stderr" >"$out"
```

#### 2. Wire Event Nested Payload Extraction
**File**: `cmd/decision/main.go`
```go
// Extract nested payload from wire event structure  
payloadBytes, err := json.Marshal(event.Payload)
var wireEventStruct struct {
    Payload json.RawMessage `json:"payload"`
}
json.Unmarshal(payloadBytes, &wireEventStruct)

// Now unmarshal the nested payload to our data struct
json.Unmarshal(wireEventStruct.Payload, &tick)
```

#### 3. Enhanced newsFile Structure
**File**: `cmd/decision/main.go`
```go
type newsFile struct {
    News []struct {
        ID             string   `json:"id"`
        Provider       string   `json:"provider"`
        PublishedAt    string   `json:"published_at_utc"`
        Headline       string   `json:"headline"`      // Added for sentiment
        Body           string   `json:"body"`          // Added for sentiment  
        URLs           []string `json:"urls"`          // Added for completeness
        Tickers        []string `json:"tickers"`
        IsPR           bool     `json:"is_press_release"`
        IsCorrection   bool     `json:"is_correction"`  // Added for completeness
        SupersedesID   *string  `json:"supersedes_id"`  // Added for completeness
        SourceWeight   float64  `json:"source_weight"`  // CRITICAL: Added for scoring
        Hash           string   `json:"headline_hash"`
    } `json:"news"`
}
```

## Test Results ✅

### All Integration Tests Now Pass
```bash
== Running: paused ==         ✅ PASS (global_pause blocks all symbols)
== Running: resumed ==        ✅ PASS (AAPL BUY_1X, NVDA REJECT, BIOX HOLD)  
== Running: after_hours ==    ✅ PASS (AAPL REJECT with session+liquidity gates)
== Running: pr_only ==        ✅ PASS (BIOX HOLD with corroboration gate)
== Running: pr_plus_editorial == ✅ PASS (BIOX BUY_5X with editorial confirmation)
== Running: pr_late_editorial == ✅ PASS (BIOX HOLD, editorial too late)
== Running: earnings_embargo == ✅ PASS (AAPL HOLD with earnings_embargo gate)
== Running: paper_outbox ==   ✅ PASS (idempotent order persistence)
== Running: wire_mode ==      ✅ PASS (AAPL BUY_1X, NVDA REJECT via wire)
```

### Wire Mode Evidence Collection
- **Tick parsing**: `Parsed tick AAPL: last=210.02 vwap=209.80` (correct values)
- **Advice generation**: 3 events (BIOX news + AAPL trend-lite + NVDA trend-lite)
- **Decision outcomes**: AAPL→BUY_1X, NVDA→REJECT (matching expected behavior)
- **Paper trading**: Orders generated in outbox with correct intents

## Risk Mitigation Achieved

### Test Reliability (High Risk → Resolved)
- **Non-deterministic failures**: Eliminated via TEST_MODE=fixtures routing
- **Time drift issues**: Fresh timestamp generation prevents window expiration  
- **Data source mixing**: Pure fixture data ensures consistent test behavior

### Wire Mode Functionality (High Risk → Resolved)  
- **Zero advice generation**: Fixed nested payload parsing
- **Missing news sentiment**: Added all required newsFile fields including SourceWeight
- **Broken trend-lite signals**: Fixed tick data extraction from wire events

### Foundation Stability (Medium Risk → Resolved)
- **Cache architecture unproven**: Wire mode validates async ingestion patterns
- **Provider abstraction untested**: Mock → Wire transitions working
- **Safety rail conflicts**: All gates continue working with wire mode

## Conclusion

**Session 16 Stage 1 is complete and successful.** The test framework is now deterministic and reliable, providing a solid foundation for live adapter integration. The critical wire mode bug fix demonstrates that the async data ingestion → advice generation → decision flow is working correctly, validating the architecture for Alpha Vantage integration.

**Ready for Session 17**: Enable Alpha Vantage shadow mode with promotion gates, leveraging the proven wire mode patterns for live provider integration.
