7. **Deployment runbook** - Complete operational procedures and troubleshooting guides
8. **Production deployment** - Safe activation procedures with kill switches

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Stage 1: Integration Testing (25-30 min)
**Full System Integration:**
```go
// cmd/decision/main.go - Multi-Provider Integration
quotesManager := adapters.NewSymbolAwareProviderManager(
    adapters.ProviderManagerConfig{
        ActiveProvider: "alphavantage",
        WarmProvider:   "polygon", 
        LiveSymbolsAllowlist: []string{"AAPL", "SPY", "NVDA", "TSLA", "QQQ"},
        CanarySymbols:       []string{"AAPL", "SPY"},
        PrioritySymbols:     []string{"AAPL", "NVDA", "SPY", "TSLA", "QQQ"},
    },
    symbolNormalizer,
)

// Register providers with hotpath protection
quotesManager.RegisterProvider("alphavantage", alphaVantageAdapter, true)
quotesManager.RegisterProvider("polygon", polygonAdapter, true) 
quotesManager.RegisterProvider("mock", mockAdapter, false)
```

**Testing Framework:**
```bash
# Comprehensive test scenarios
go test ./internal/adapters/ -run TestMultiProvider -timeout 5m -v
go test ./internal/adapters/ -run TestFailoverScenarios -timeout 5m -v
go test ./internal/adapters/ -run TestHotpathProtection -timeout 5m -v

# Integration tests with live providers (test accounts)
INTEGRATION_TESTS=true POLYGON_API_KEY=test_key go test ./...
```

### Stage 2: Operational Scripts (15-20 min)
**Emergency Procedures:**
```bash
# scripts/emergency-failover.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Emergency provider failover with monitoring
echo "ðŸš¨ Emergency failover from $1 to $2"
./scripts/health-check.sh --provider $1
./scripts/activate-provider.sh --provider $2 --reason "emergency_failover"
./scripts/monitor-transition.sh --duration 300 # 5 min monitoring
```

**Health Monitoring:**
```bash  
# scripts/monitor-providers.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Real-time multi-provider health monitoring
while true; do
    curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8090/healthz/providers | jq '.providers[] | {name, status, success_rate, p95_latency_ms}'
    sleep 30
done
```

### Stage 3: Production Deployment (15-20 min)
**Safe Deployment Procedure:**
```yaml
# Production-ready configuration
# config/live_feeds.yaml  
feeds:
  quotes:
    live_enabled: true                     # Enable live mode
    shadow_mode: true                      # Keep shadow comparison
    provider_active: "alphavantage"        # Primary provider
    provider_warm: "polygon"               # Warm spare
    live_symbols_allowlist: ["AAPL", "SPY"] # Start with canary
    
    # Promotion gates for live activation
    promotion_gates:
      min_success_rate: 0.99              # 99% success rate required
      max_p95_latency_ms: 200             # 200ms P95 latency limit
      min_cache_hit_rate: 0.80            # 80% cache efficiency
      max_shadow_mismatch_rate: 0.02      # 2% shadow mismatch limit
      validation_window_minutes: 30       # 30 min validation required
```

**Kill Switch Testing:**
```bash
# Test emergency procedures
./scripts/test-kill-switches.sh
# Expected: System degrades gracefully to mock within 2 seconds

./scripts/test-provider-failover.sh 
# Expected: Provider switch within 10 seconds, full recovery within 30 seconds
```
