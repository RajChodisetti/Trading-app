# Session 16: Live Quote Feeds & System Integration

## Session Overview
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes  
**Type**: Integration & Testing  
**Focus**: Activate live quote feeds safely with deterministic testing and promotion gates

## Context from Session 15
‚úÖ **Session 15 Completed**: Real adapter integration architecture with 6 major new files (~2000+ lines)
- Background quote refresher with cache-first decision reads  
- Provider health monitoring with automatic fallback
- Shadow mode for halts/news validation
- VCR and chaos testing frameworks
- Comprehensive observability and feature flags

üêõ **Issue Identified**: Pre-existing test framework inconsistency where AAPL trend-lite signals aren't generated consistently, causing integration test failures unrelated to Session 15 adapter work.

## Session 16 Goals

### Primary Objective: Live Quote Feed Activation with Safety Gates
1. **Fix test framework deterministically** - Inject test clock, single quote source routing
2. **Enable Alpha Vantage shadow mode** - With hysteresis and promotion gates  
3. **Validate quote cache performance** - Ensure decision p95 <200ms, hotpath isolation
4. **Test fallback mechanisms** - Verify Mock‚ÜíCache‚ÜíAlphaVantage with auto-recovery

### Secondary Objectives: Production Readiness
5. **Rate limit + adaptive cadence** - Budget-aware refresh intervals with priority symbols
6. **Health monitoring with hysteresis** - Prevent flapping with consecutive-breach rules
7. **Observability + compliance** - /healthz endpoint, payload scanning, structured logs
8. **Promotion criteria validation** - 30-60min window of stable metrics before live activation

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Stage 1: Test Framework Deterministic Fix (15-20 min)
**Problem**: Mock adapter AAPL quotes vs ticks.json fixture inconsistency + time drift
**Solution**: Option C + deterministic improvements:
- **TEST_MODE environment routing**: `fixtures` vs `mock` quote sources per test suite
- **Inject test clock**: Replace `time.Now()` calls in trend-lite with configurable time
- **Golden intent validation**: Add one-liner AAPL/NVDA/SPY intent map check after `make test`

**Config Addition**:
```bash
# Test routing
export TEST_MODE=fixtures  # or "mock" 
export TEST_CLOCK_FREEZE=true
```

**Expected Outcome**: Integration tests pass consistently with no time/data source drift

### Stage 2: Alpha Vantage Shadow Mode with Promotion Gates (20-25 min)
**Config Changes** (`config/live_feeds.yaml`):
```yaml
feeds:
  quotes:
    live_enabled: false                    # Keep false until promotion gates met
    shadow_mode: true                      # Enable shadow mode
    provider: "alphavantage"               # Switch from mock
    refresh_interval_ms: 800               # Base refresh rate
    freshness_ceiling_seconds: 5           # RTH staleness limit  
    hysteresis_seconds: 3                  # Prevent flapping
    consecutive_breach_to_degrade: 3       # Require 3 consecutive failures
    consecutive_ok_to_recover: 5           # Require 5 consecutive successes
    daily_request_cap: 300                 # Conservative daily limit
    fallback_to_mock: true                 # Ultimate fallback
    # Priority symbol ordering for adaptive cadence
    priority_symbols: ["AAPL", "NVDA", "SPY", "TSLA", "QQQ"]
```

**Promotion Gates (30-60min window required)**:
- ‚úÖ p95 freshness ‚â§ 5s RTH (‚â§ 60s AH) 
- ‚úÖ p95 decision latency ‚â§ 200ms
- ‚úÖ Success rate ‚â• 99% (non-error fetches)
- ‚úÖ Zero liquidity-gate stalls from quote staleness
- ‚úÖ `hotpath_live_calls_total == 0` (cache isolation verified)

**Shadow Comparison Heuristics**:
- Spread ratio `spread_live/spread_mock` within [0.5, 2.0]
- Mid difference ‚â§ X bps for large caps
- Timestamp delta ‚â§ freshness ceiling
- Emit `shadow_mismatch_total{kind="spread|mid|staleness"}`

**Evidence Collection**: 5-10 screenshots/log snippets of stable metrics for session doc

### Stage 3: Health & Fallback Testing with Auto-Recovery (15-20 min)
**Test Scenarios**:
1. **Rate limit simulation**: Exceed daily cap threshold ‚Üí adaptive cadence + fallback
2. **DNS failure simulation**: Point base URL to unroutable host ‚Üí timeout handling
3. **Stale data handling**: Force quotes older than freshness ceiling ‚Üí degraded state
4. **Auto-recovery validation**: Restore provider ‚Üí consecutive-ok recovery to healthy
5. **Kill switch test**: Flip `disable_live_quotes=true` mid-run ‚Üí graceful exit + cache/mock continuation

**Expected Behavior with Hysteresis**:
- Health state changes only after K consecutive breaches/successes (no flapping)
- Automatic fallback: Live ‚Üí Cache ‚Üí Mock with structured transition logging
- Auto-recovery cool-off: require 5 consecutive healthy probes before leaving failed
- Decision engine continues operating (zero blocked decisions)

### Stage 4: Enhanced Observability + Compliance (10-15 min)
**New /healthz Endpoint** (easier than jq on /metrics):
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8090/healthz | jq
# Expected: {"provider":"alphavantage","status":"healthy","freshness_p95_s":2.1,"error_rate_5m":0.0,"fallback":"none"}
```

**Compliance Scanning**:
```bash
# Unit test to scan logs/metrics for API keys or raw payloads
go test -run TestComplianceGuard ./internal/adapters
```

**Key Metrics to Validate**:
- `hotpath_live_calls_total == 0` (decision isolation)
- `fallback_activations_total{to="cache|mock"}` + recovery histograms
- `shadow_mismatch_total{kind="spread|mid|staleness"}` < 2%
- Health transition events in structured logs

### Stage 5: Production Readiness Validation (5-10 min)
**Enhanced Pre-Flight Checklist**:
- [ ] **Hotpath isolation**: `hotpath_live_calls_total == 0` verified
- [ ] **Promotion gates met**: 30-60min window of stable metrics documented
- [ ] **Kill switches functional**: `disable_live_quotes=true` ‚Üí graceful degradation
- [ ] **Compliance verified**: No payloads/API keys found in logs (TestComplianceGuard passes)
- [ ] **Auto-recovery tested**: Failed ‚Üí Healthy transition in <5min after restoration
- [ ] **Adaptive cadence**: Budget-aware refresh interval adjustment verified

## Enhanced Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have ‚úÖ (Strengthened)
1. **Tests deterministic**: Integration tests pass consistently with injected clock + TEST_MODE
2. **Hotpath isolation**: `hotpath_live_calls_total == 0` throughout session
3. **Promotion gates met**: ‚â•30min window of p95 freshness ‚â§5s, latency ‚â§200ms, success rate ‚â•99%
4. **Fallback chain verified**: Live ‚Üí Cache ‚Üí Mock with structured logging
5. **Compliance validated**: TestComplianceGuard passes (no API keys/payloads in logs)

### Should Have üìã (Enhanced)
6. **Shadow mismatch ratio**: <2% of samples across priority symbols
7. **Auto-recovery validated**: Failed ‚Üí Healthy in <5min with consecutive-ok rules
8. **Health hysteresis**: State changes only after K consecutive breaches (no flapping)
9. **Adaptive cadence**: Refresh interval widens when budget <15%, shrinks when >40%

### Nice to Have ‚ûï (Production-Ready)
10. **Structured health events**: from/to/reason/window_stats in logs
11. **Symbol prioritization**: Positions > watchlist > rest during budget constraints
12. **Shadow comparison alerts**: Spread/mid/staleness mismatch detection

## Risk Mitigation (Enhanced)

### High Risk üö® (Tightened)
- **Latency spikes**: Hotpath isolation ensures decision loop reads only from cache (`cache_miss_total == 0`)
- **Quota burn**: Adaptive cadence + per-symbol priority + daily cap hard stop
- **Health flapping**: Hysteresis (3 consecutive failures) + K-consecutive recovery rule

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è (New Controls)
- **Test drift**: Injected clock + single quote source per suite (TEST_MODE routing)
- **Provider reliability**: Shadow mode + automatic fallback with auto-recovery
- **Data quality**: Shadow comparison heuristics catch suspicious spread/mid/staleness differences

### Low Risk ‚ÑπÔ∏è (Operational)  
- **Promotion timing**: Clear 30-60min stability gates prevent premature live activation
- **Configuration complexity**: /healthz JSON endpoint simplifies monitoring vs metrics scraping
- **Compliance audit**: TestComplianceGuard scans for payload/API key leakage

## Session Handoff Notes

**If Session 16 is incomplete:**
- Core adapter architecture from Session 15 is production-ready
- Test framework issues are pre-existing, not from Session 15 work  
- Live quote feeds can be activated independently of test fixes
- Shadow mode is safest first step before full live activation

**If Session 16 succeeds:**
- Ready for Session 17: Live halts feed integration
- Quote cache architecture validated for other data feeds
- Provider health monitoring proven for scaled deployment

## Files to Focus On
- `config/live_feeds.yaml` - Feature flag configuration
- `internal/adapters/integration_test.go` - Test framework fixes
- `cmd/decision/main.go` - AAPL trend-lite signal debugging
- `fixtures/ticks.json` - Test data consistency
- `scripts/run-tests.sh` - Test harness validation

## Environment Setup (Enhanced)
```bash
# Required for live integration
export ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY="your_key_here"  
export LIVE_QUOTES_ENABLED="false"           # Shadow mode first

# Test determinism controls
export TEST_MODE="fixtures"                  # or "mock" for different suites
export TEST_CLOCK_FREEZE="true"             # Inject deterministic time

# Validation pipeline
make test                                     # Baseline test pass with golden intent check
go test -run TestComplianceGuard ./internal/adapters  # API key/payload scanning
go run ./cmd/decision -oneshot=true          # Manual quote validation
curl http://127.0.0.1:8090/healthz | jq     # Health endpoint validation
```
